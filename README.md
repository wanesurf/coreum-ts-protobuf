# Coreum TS Protobuf

This repository contains the instructions on how to generate the typescript protobuf files used to interact with the Coreum blockchain using gRPC.

## How it works

What the tool does is:

1. Clones the repository of the Cosmos-SDK and Coreum.
2. Extracts the protos of the modules that we want to generate.
3. Generates the protobuf files using `buf generate`.

## Prerequisites

Install the code generator, the runtime library, and the Buf CLI:

```bash
npm install @bufbuild/protobuf @bufbuild/protoc-gen-es @bufbuild/buf
```

## How to use

1. Clone the Coreum repository with the branch that you want, in this case we are going to clone the `master` branch.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:CoreumFoundation/coreum.git
```

2. Clone the Cosmos SDK repository with the branch that you want, in this case we are going to clone the `v0.47.5` branch, but you can use any branch you want.

```bash
git clone --branch v0.47.5 git@github.com:cosmos/cosmos-sdk.git
```

3. Copy all the proto files in the current directory.

```bash
cp -r ./cosmos-sdk/proto/ ./coreum/proto/ .
```

4. Run the `buf generate` command with the template provided in this repository.

```bash
npx buf generate ./proto/ --template buf.gen.yaml -o ./ts-protos
```

This will generate all the typescript protobuf files in the `ts-protos` directory.
